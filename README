Compilation Instructions:
-------------------------

run 'make' in the terminal

This will compile the following binary deliverables:

binder 
librpc.a 

rpc.h can be accessed by including it from 'rpc_src/rpc.h'

Dependencies:
-------------
Most of the necessary libraries the implementation depends on are standard C++ libraries which require no extra steps when compiling the programs

However, the librpc.a library depends on pthreads which can be included at the linking phase with the compiler flag '-lpthread' as the following:

---
g++ -L. client.o -lrpc -lpthread -o client
g++ -L. server_functions.o server_function_skels.o server.o -lrpc -lpthread -o server
---
Once everything is compiled, the programs can be executed as described in the assignment specifications
